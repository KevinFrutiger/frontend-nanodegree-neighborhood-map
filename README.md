# Neighborhood Map project

This was the fifth project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The objective was to build a application featuring a Google Map and a filtered list of places, utilizing the Knockout MVVM framework, the Google Maps API, and additional third-party APIs (i.e. AJAX requests).

## Running the application

You can run the live application [here](https://kevinfrutiger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map/).

You can run the files locally by doing the following:

1. Download the .zip file using the **Download ZIP** button located in the GitHub sidebar (or clone the repository).
2. Unzip the file
3. Point your browser to index.html in the **src** folder of the files that you just unzipped to run the non-minified files. Point your browser to index.html in the **deploy** folder to run the same files found on the live site.

### Filter the map results

The map displays markers for the places listed in the filter menu. You can filter the locations shown by entering text in the input field. The list and markers will only show for those place names that match the text you've entered.
