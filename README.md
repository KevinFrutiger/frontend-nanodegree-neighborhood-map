# Neighborhood Map project

This was the fifth project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. The objective was to build a application featuring a Google Map and a filtered list of places, utilizing the Knockout MVVM framework, the Google Maps API, and additional third-party APIs (i.e. AJAX requests).
